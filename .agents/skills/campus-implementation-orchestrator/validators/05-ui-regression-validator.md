# Validator — Phase 5

## Purpose
Compare baseline and current homepage, navigation, event cards/detail, calendar, auth, and responsive behavior. Reject unnecessary visual changes.


## Common gate

Run only commands that exist in the repository. Discover equivalents when necessary.

Required evidence:
- commands executed
- exit status
- tests executed and result
- files changed
- security-sensitive changes, if any

Never edit validator tests merely to make them pass.


## Result contract

Return one of:

PASS
or

FAIL

If FAIL, list:
1. exact failing check
2. evidence
3. expected behavior
4. actual behavior
5. minimal fix required

Do not advance the phase on FAIL.
